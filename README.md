## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (optional, for full functionality)
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etn-watchdog.git
   cd etn-watchdog
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Configure AI features:

   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_AI=false  # Set to true to use mock AI responses instead of real API
   ```

### Running the Application

#### With Mock Data (Default)

This mode uses mock data and doesn't require a connection to the Electroneum blockchain:

```bash
./start-app.sh --mock
```

#### With Testnet Data

This mode connects to the Electroneum testnet and uses real blockchain data:

```bash
./start-app.sh --testnet
```

#### With Mainnet Data

This mode connects to the Electroneum mainnet and uses real blockchain data:

```bash
./start-app.sh --mainnet
```

### Switching Data Sources in the UI

You can also switch between data sources directly in the UI:

1. Look for the "Data Source" dropdown in the top-right corner of the dashboard
2. Select your preferred data source:
   - Mock Data: Uses locally generated mock data
   - Electroneum Testnet: Connects to the Electroneum testnet
   - Electroneum Mainnet: Connects to the Electroneum mainnet

Note: Switching data sources in the UI will reload the page to refresh the data.

REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_AI=false
```

## üß™ Running on Testnet

To run ETN Watchdog on the Electroneum testnet instead of mainnet, follow these steps:

1. Update your `.env` file to use testnet configuration:

   ```
   # Comment out mainnet URLs
   # ELECTRONEUM_RPC_URL=https://rpc.electroneum.com
   # WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=https://rpc.electroneum.com

   # Uncomment testnet URLs
   ELECTRONEUM_RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/electroneum_testnet
   WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/electroneum_testnet

   # Set chain ID to testnet
   NETWORK_CHAIN_ID=5201420
   ```

2. Get testnet ETN from the Electroneum testnet faucet (if available) or request from the Electroneum team.

3. Deploy the contracts to testnet:

   ```
   npm run deploy:testnet
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run start:all
   ```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB
- Electroneum wallet with ETN for contract deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etn-watchdog.git
   cd etn-watchdog
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then fill in your configuration details.

4. Compile smart contracts:

   ```
   npm run compile
   ```

5. Deploy smart contracts:

   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run start:all
   ```

## üß™ Running on Testnet

To run ETN Watchdog on the Electroneum testnet instead of mainnet, follow these steps:

1. Update your `.env` file to use testnet configuration:

   ```
   # Comment out mainnet URLs
   # ELECTRONEUM_RPC_URL=https://rpc.electroneum.com
   # WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=https://rpc.electroneum.com

   # Uncomment testnet URLs
   ELECTRONEUM_RPC_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/electroneum_testnet
   WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=https://rpc.ankr.com/electroneum_testnet

   # Set chain ID to testnet
   NETWORK_CHAIN_ID=5201420
   ```

2. Get testnet ETN from the Electroneum testnet faucet (if available) or request from the Electroneum team.

3. Deploy the contracts to testnet:

   ```
   npm run deploy:testnet
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run start:all
   ```

The application will now connect to the Electroneum testnet instead of mainnet.
